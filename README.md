# advent-of-code-2020

My solutions to advent of code (https://adventofcode.com/2020)

Languages used for solutions:
* Days 1-9: Python
* Days 10-12: Haskell
* Days 13-14: Python
* Day 15: Haskell

All the haskell solutions need to be run in a `stack` environment, such as the one seen in day 10. For other days that use haskell I haven't uploaded all the stack files as they're quite cluttered. To download `stack` please visit https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/ To run use `stack run` but ensure all imported dependencies such as `intMaps` have been added to the `.cabal` file. 

Python scripts are pretty straightforward and run as you would expect I suggest using `python3` as follows: `python3 filename.py`
